# CMPE283 : Virtualization Technology
# Assignment 3 : Instrumentation via hypercall

 


#### Student names: Manjiri Kadam, Pranjali Kotgire
#### University Name: San Jose State University

### Prerequisites
â€¢ You will need a machine capable of running Linux, with VMX or SVM virtualization features exposed.
You may be able to do this inside a VM, or maybe not, depending on your hardware and software
configuration. You should likely be using the environment you created for assignment 2.

## Question 1:
### Assignment Contribution of each Team Member
#### Pranjali Kotgire 

1. Completed the code for CPUID leaf node %eax = 0x4FFFFFFE part with Manjiri
2. Utilised the setup we implemented for assignment 2.
3. Modified the cpuid.c and vmx.c file on extension to the assignment 2
4. Recorded Answers for asked questions.

#### Manjiri Kadam
1. Refered the ppt and lecture. Learned about exits with help of SDM
2. Modified the cpuid.c and vmx.c file on extension to assignment 2.
3. Noted the number of exits and output by running test files and recorded the output in readme.md file along with the screenshots.
4. Answered the asked question.

Please Refer to Assignment 2, as we have used the same enviroment for Assignment 3

## Question 2:
### Steps Performed For Assignment:
1.To calculate the total time spent processing all exits and the time spent processing the exit number for the particular case, we made changes in vmx.c file and cpuid.c file.

2.Then compile and build the modules using following commands:

`nproc`
`make -j 4 && make -j 4 modules / make -j 2 && make -j 2 modules` (depends on proc value)

3.Install the modules using below commands:

`make modules_install && make install `

4.Install cpuid package in the inner VM:

`sudo apt-get install cpuid`
